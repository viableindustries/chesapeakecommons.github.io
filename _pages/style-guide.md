The Viable Industries style guidelines document provides examples of how color, type, and layout elements should be used throughout the Viable Industries brand website and other online Viable Industries properties.

These guidelines should be strictly adhered to in order that a consistent and recognizable brand be established for Viable Industries. These guidelines are effective immediately and used until a new brand manual is distributed.
