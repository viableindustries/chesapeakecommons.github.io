We believe information transparency is the foundation for effective public engagement, thoughtful decision making, and meaningful social change.

We help humans collect useful data, understand their data, and share it with others.

So they can help students better understand science and technology through creative play, dedicate more time in the field stewarding our natural resources, focus on their cause effecting meaningful social change, and share more authentic stories, engaging the public and sharing knowledge.

Because of the things we create from web and mobile applications, to software, dynamic editorial content, and data infrastructure.

<h3 class="alt">Purpose</h3>

We are here to design and build great software and systems that help humans build a healthier world.

<h3>What’s important to us?</h3>

Family, Community, and Environment.

- Our team, their partners, children, and pets are our family. 
- Our community is all around, from the offices we work in, to the communities we pass through on our commute, until we get home. Everyone we come in to contact with is our community and we are there to
serve them directly and indirectly.
- Our environment is gives us what we need to survive, food, water, oxygen. Without it we are nothing.

Before accepting new projects we first ask our selves, “Is this project going to provide value and positively impact our Family, our Communities, and our Environment?”

Unless we can answer a resounding “Yes” to all three groups, we walk away from the project.


Practicality.
