We are a company that builds software for the web and mobile technologies. Every project weâ€™ve worked on involves the work of others, the majority of these people we have never met. Open source data, ideas, and code have empowered our small studio to build tools that should have taken much larger teams with much larger budgets and much longer timeframes.

We are building on the ideas and code of many other very talented people. Keeping in tune with the open source mind set we are committed to contributing to existing open-source projects in addition to open sourcing as much of our work as is possible.
