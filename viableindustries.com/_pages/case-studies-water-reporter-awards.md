    <blockquote>
      “With a mission to stop pollution and clean the waters of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers through public awareness, community action, and law enforcement, Potomac Riverkeeper’s winning innovation was a mobile application that allows its users to identify and report pollution problems in real time with photos and geo-tagging.  The app has already begun to revolutionize the work of conservationists, making identifying and responding to pollution problems a more effective and precise process.” <sup><a href="#source-001">1</a></sup>
