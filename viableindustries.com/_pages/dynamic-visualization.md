### Examples

We should have 2-4 examples for this. The content should appear in blocks and each one should focus on a specific application of the type of visuzalization. For example, Maps could be the BlueWaterBaltimore home page, Charts could be the Ashtracker station page, Reports could be the NFWF metrics, and Custom could be the FPW Grants single page.

Each of those should link to a specific Partner Case Study page (e.g., HarborAlert, Ashtracker, Foundation PA Watersheds, NFWF).
