We believe strong relationships in our personal and business lives, are built on communication, honesty, and trust. Without any of these three elements, any relationship is doomed.

In 2015 we will be exploring a new initiative in which we will test the waters of opening our books to the organizations we collaborate and partner with. At this time weâ€™re still figuring out what this means, how we will pull the most important pieces out, and ultimately how we will share that information with our partner organizations.

Have questions about our transparent organization initiative? Please get in touch via email or telephone.
